Analytical Insight 

there are two groups of employees who left the company: (A) those who worked considerably less than their peers with the same number of projects, and (B) those who worked much more. Of those in group A, it's possible that they were fired. It's also possible that this group includes employees who had already given their notice and were assigned fewer hours because they were already on their way out the door. For those in group B, it's reasonable to infer that they probably quit. The folks in group B likely contributed a lot to the projects they worked in; they might have been the largest contributors to their projects.


Everyone with seven projects left the company,  those who left with six projects was ~255–295 hours/month—much more than any other group.

The optimal number of projects for employees to work on seems to be 3–4. The ratio of left/stayed is very small for these cohorts.

working long hours doesn't guarantee a good evaluation score.

It appears that employees are leaving the company as a result of poor management. Leaving is tied to longer working hours, many projects, and generally lower satisfaction levels. It can be ungratifying to work long hours and not receive promotions or good evaluation scores. There's a sizeable group of employees at this company who are probably burned out. It also appears that if an employee has spent more than six years at the company, they tend not to leave.
